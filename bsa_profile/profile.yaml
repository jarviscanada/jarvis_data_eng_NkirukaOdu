summary: Interfacing between business and technology interests me a lot. I obtained a master's degree in Computer Science from the African University of Science and Technology. I have about three years of working experience as an assistant program coordinator at Nile University. I have developed good communication, collaboration, documentation, and presentation skills through team collaboration to prepare project proposals and organize other academic activities. I am passionate about working in an environment where I can actively collaborate with other team members to develop efficient business information technology systems by fostering the active use of emerging technologies and techniques to help them achieve strategic business goals. I am currently seeking a full-time role as a Business System Analyst (BSA). Working as a junior BSA at Jarvis gave me a good opportunity to work in an Agile/Scrum environment. I have developed skills such as documentation, presentation, analytical thinking, requirement elicitation, and interpersonal and confrontation skills by working on different projects to provide business solutions using the latest technologies such as Python(Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib), SQL, Data Mapping, Data modeling, and Git/Github. Learning new skills and how to apply them to solve real-world problems motivates me a lot!

    description: The Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App is used by the Linux cluster agents to collect hardware specifications and resource usage information. I prepared the business requirement documents (BRD) to show the basic requirements, the project objectives, the need statement, project scope, and programming language, identified the stakeholders and performed elicitation through open interviews, outlined the project timeline/milestone/deadline, and the cost-benefit analysis. I also prepared the System requirement document (SRD) to show the system's behavior and the functional and non-functional requirements. I wrote some SQL statements and created data models and ER diagrams to show how different entities are related and the use case diagram to show the functional behaviors.

    description: Implemented an XGBoost model to predict customers who will default on their credit card payments. I prepared the BRD to ensure a proper plan and implementation of the project. I used Pandas for data analysis and Matplotlib for data visualization and presentation. Python, Git, Dash, and an XGBoost model for the implementation. The predictors used include Limited Balance, Total bill, Total paid, Payment Level, Age, and Education level. The model was trained and tested using a real-world dataset obtained from the UCI repository. The predictive result showed a 94% accuracy. The project was deployed to Heroku
