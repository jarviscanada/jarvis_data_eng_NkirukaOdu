# Nkiruka Odu . Jarvis Consulting

The field of software engineering is exciting and also comes with a lot of expectations. I love the fact that It allows me to be creative and productive. I am diligent and possess strong agility for learning. Working as a junior developer at Jarvis exposed me to the entire spectrum of software development, having worked on different projects using technologies like Python, Java, SQL, Bash, Maven, Docker, and Agile methodology, my problem solving skills improved a lot while working with Jarvis. Learning new skills and technologies excites me a lot and I hope to keep working hard to always meet up with the most needed industrial skills and technologies.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NkirukaOdu](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NkirukaOdu)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NkirukaOdu/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Linux cluster monitoring agent that runs on centos7 through the google cloud platform. LCMA helps to collect hardware information and then provides the resource usage information of the host computer on a server. LCMA is used by Linux cluster agents to monitor the resource usage of each host computer on the server every 5 minutes. The project was developed using bash scripts, SQL(PostgreSQL), git/git-flow, docker, and the Google cloud platform. The project was tested using some bash commands on the terminal and was deployed to git using crontab to automate its functionality. .

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NkirukaOdu/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - JDBC App: Implemented a JDBC App that uses the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) to perform queries on a PostgreSQL database containing customer records and their orders from a retail store. The CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations were implemented using Data Access Objects(DAO) and Data Transfer Objects (DTO). I used a containerized PostgreSQL while maven handled all the project dependencies. The project was implemented using Java core, Maven, JDBC, PostgreSQL, Docker, and DBeaver. 
  - Grep App: Worked in an Agile team to implement a grep app that recursively searches through each line of a text file and returns a sequence of strings matching the user-specified input. This grep project was written using Java 8 and utilises new Java 8 features such as Lambda, Collections, and Streams API that improve parallel data processing. Maven was used for managing the project build, and handling dependencies. The project was deployed using docker on the docker hub

## Highlighted Projects
**Web-based App to predict credit card defaulters** [[GitHub](https://github.com/write2nk/Unit2-example)]: Implemented an XGBoost model to predict customers who will default on their credit card payments. The project was implemented using Python, git, Dash, and a machine learning model, The predictors used include The model was trained and tested using a real-world dataset and the predictive result showed a 96% accuracy. The project was deployed to Heroku.

**Machine Learning web-based app to predict interest rate** [[GitHub](https://github.com/write2nk/predict_ir)]: Implemented a machine learning-based app for predicting interest rates for potential customers who may wish to be lent money by the lending club. The project was implemented using Random Forest Classifier, python, bash, and git. The model was trained, tested, and validated using the real-world dataset. The project was deployed to Heroku.
