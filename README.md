# Nkiruka Odu . Jarvis Consulting

The field of software engineering is exciting and also comes with a lot of expectations. I love the fact that It allows me to be creative and productive.  I obtained a Master's of Science (MSc) Degree in Computer Science from the African University of Science and Technology. I also received a nano degree training in Data Science from International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP). I have about 2 years of experience in Python, Pandas, and Numpy.  Working as a junior developer at Jarvis exposed me to the entire spectrum of software development, having worked on different projects using technologies like Python, Java, SQL, Bash, Maven, Docker, and Agile methodology, my problem-solving skills also improved a lot while working with Jarvis. I am diligent and possess strong agility for learning. Learning new skills and technologies excites me a lot and I hope to keep working hard to always meet up with the most needed industrial skills and techniques.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NkirukaOdu](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NkirukaOdu)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NkirukaOdu/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a cluster monitor (CM) that runs on centos7 through the google cloud platform. LC collects hardware information and then provides the resource usage information of the host computer on a server. LC is used by Linux cluster agents to monitor the resource usage of each host computer on the server every 5 minutes. The project was developed using bash scripts, SQL(PostgreSQL), git/git-flow, docker. The project was tested using some bash commands on the terminal and was deployed using crontab. The source code is on github.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NkirukaOdu/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - JDBC App:  Implemented a JDBC App that uses the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) to perform queries on a PostgreSQL database containing customer records and orders from a retail store. The CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations were implemented using Data Access Objects (DAO) and Data Transfer Objects (DTO). I used a containerized PostgreSQL database while maven handled all the project dependencies. The project was implemented using Java 8, Maven, JDBC, PostgreSQL, Docker, and DBeaver.
  - Grep App: Worked in an Agile team to implement a grep app that recursively searches through each line of a text file and returns a sequence of strings matching the user-specified input. This grep app was written using Java 8 and utilizes new Java 8 features such as Lambda and Streams API that improve parallel data processing. Maven was used for managing the project build, and handling dependencies. The project was deployed using docker.


## Highlighted Projects
**Credit card default Predictor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/write2nk/Unit2-example)]: Implemented an XGBoost model to predict customers who will default on their credit card payments. The project was implemented using Python, git, Dash, and an XGBoost machine learning model. The predictors used include Limited Balance, Total bill, Total paid, Payment Level, Age, and Education level. The model was trained and tested using a real-world dataset obtained from the UCI repository. The predictive result showed a 96% accuracy. The project was deployed to Heroku.

**Interest rate Predictor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/write2nk/predict_ir)]: Implemented a machine learning-based app for predicting interest rates for potential customers who may wish to be lent money by the lending club. The project was implemented using Random Forest, Python, bash, and git. The model was trained, tested, and validated using a real-world dataset obtained from kaggle repository. The project was deployed to Heroku.
