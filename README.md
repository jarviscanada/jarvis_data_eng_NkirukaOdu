# Nkiruka Odu . Jarvis Consulting

Interfacing between business and technology interests me a lot. I obtained a master's degree in Computer Science from the African University of Science and Technology. I have about three years of working experience as a program coordinator at Nile University. I have developed good communication, collaboration, documentation, and presentation skills through team collaboration to prepare project proposals and organize other academic activities. I am passionate about working in an environment where I can actively collaborate with other team members to develop efficient business information technology systems by fostering the active use of emerging technologies and techniques to help them achieve strategic business goals. I am currently seeking a full-time role as a Business System Analyst (BSA).

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NkirukaOdu](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NkirukaOdu)


**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NkirukaOdu/tree/master/linux_sql)]: The Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App is used by the Linux cluster agents to collect hardware specifications and resource usage information. I prepared the business requirement documents (BRD) to show the basic requirements, the project objectives, the need statement, project scope, and programming language, identified the stakeholders and performed elicitation through open interviews, outlined the project timeline/milestone/deadline, and the cost-benefit analysis. I also prepared the System requirement document (SRD) to show the system's behavior and the functional and non-functional requirements. I wrote some SQL statements and created data models and ER diagrams to show how different entities are related and the use case diagram to show the functional behaviors.

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NkirukaOdu/tree/master/python_data_analytics)]: This project focused on analysing the customer's shopping behavior of an online store to help the business owner understand their customers' behaviour in order to develop good sales and marketing strategies that can increase their revenue. I performed the requirement elicitation by gathering information from the stakeholders. Data was fetched from the company's PSQL data warehouse in the cloud. I performed the data wrangling and analytics processes and properly documented the analytical results that enhanced their business decision which helped them to improve their business strategies and increased their revenue. Project was implemented using Python programming and its libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SQLAchemy on a Jupyter notebook.


## Highlighted Projects
**Credit card default Predictor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/write2nk/Unit2-example)]: Implemented an XGBoost model to predict customers who will default on their credit card payments. I prepared the BRD to ensure a proper plan and implementation of the project. I used Pandas for data analysis and Matplotlib for data visualization and presentation. Python, Git, Dash, and an XGBoost model for the implementation. The predictors used include Limited Balance, Total bill, Total paid, Payment Level, Age, and Education level. The model was trained and tested using a real-world dataset obtained from the UCI repository. The predictive result showed a 94% accuracy. The project was deployed to Heroku.


## Professional Experiences

**Business System Analyst, Jarvis (2022-present)**: 
**Project Scope:** The project was aimed at automating the code deliveries process on ISPW for MainFrame(MF) applications to help save cost on RUN resources  and manual efforts for the team at the Bank of Montreal (BMO).
- Collaborated with a cross-functional scrum team to identify technical business problems and opportunities for improvement that can be addressed through automation. This led to 40% of the processes being streamlined.
- Elicited requirements from the stakeholders and converting them to user stories in JIRA while maintaining and prioritizing the product backlog
- Organized walkthrough sessions with MF application development teams and other stakeholders to discuss opportunities in ISPW automation which lead to less dependency on PROD support teams for implementations by 47%
- Worked across teams to move MF applications delivery from being manually run to automated delivery which helped to eliminate approx 3500 hours of manual effort involved in PROD MF deploys
- Used data reporting and visualization tools to analyze change and Incident records charged by the TCS by using SQL and advanced excel to ensure accurate decisions are made 
- Managed Service Now ticket systems for the MF Application support team to track  Change records(CRs) and Incident Record(IRs)
- Created user manuals, training guides, product documentations and KB articles to ensure a smooth transition of changes from manual delivery to automated delivery on ISPW
- Assisted in UAT by ensuring that all test cases were mapped to acceptance criteria, leading to 46% increase in development quality.



**Program Coordinator, Nile University (2019 - 2021)**: 
- Led to planning and coordination of programs, prepared funding proposals for grants and other sources through requirement elicitation, and stakeholder analysis, and documented and presented the manuscript for approval before submission which led to successful grants.
- Led team to organize academic activities and outreaches, ensured that all requirements are completed timely before the specified deadline.
- Collaborated with the IT teams to improve the student management system(SMS), to enhance user experience and interface, increasing system efficiency while boosting user retention rate by 30%.

**Business Process Analyst, RFID Research & Development Centre (2017 - 2018):** <br>
**Project Focus:** This project involved research and development to implement machine learning models on RFID-enabled studentâ€™s management system
- Documented current state processes and identified gaps while working with the development team to determine an effective future state.
- Conducted user interviews with the intended students(users) and other stakeholders to elicit and document clear functional and non-functional requirements. 
- Designed low-fidelity mock-ups using Balsamiq to illustrate User Interface to the development team
- Led scrum team to ensure the accurate delivery of key features and functionalities by being voice of customer (VOC)
- Participated in UAT to ensure that all test cases were mapped to Acceptance criteria, this led to 40% increase in development quality.
